# PayNow Plugin for Hytale

## Configuration

After the plugin is automatically installed and configured for the first time, you may want to customize its settings, such as the server connection token and the command fetch interval.

### Setting Your Token

To connect your server with the PayNow gameserver, set your unique PayNow token using the following server command:

```plaintext
/paynow link <token>
```

Replace `<token>` with your actual PayNow token.

### Adjusting Fetch Interval

The default fetch interval is recommended for most servers, but you can adjust it to meet your specific needs by modifying the config.
